				this taser produces very high voltages and can lead to massive
				damages if not used with caution.

			<p id='text'>
				- a power supply unit of an old pc
				<br>
				- copper wire / earphones that were cut on both ends
				<br>
				- 4 × 9V Batterys (you can use lower volt batterys, but every
				volt less increases your reload time)
				<br>
				- Crocodile clips (to connect the batterys with the capacitor)
				<br>
				- Duct tape (Not necessary, but it could help you if you need to
				insulate something or fix something in place)
				<br>
				- a button
				<br>
				- a Screwdriver

				<b> 1. Step </b>
				<br>
				Connect the 4 × 9v Batterys together, like this:
				<a href='pic/batterys.JPG' target='_blank'>
					Here the image.<!--<img src='pic/batterys.JPG' alt='4-Batterys connected together'>-->
				</a>
				<br>
				<br>
				(they do not need to be some expensive ones, I just used some from IKEA for 2€ a piece)
			</p>

				<b> 2. Step </b>
				<br>
				Open the old pc and remove the power supply unit. The
				power supply unit can normally be found in the area I marked in the pictures.
				<br>
				<a href='pic/power_supply_unit_1.JPG' target='_blank'>
					Here the image.<!--<img src='pic/power_supply_unit_1.JPG' alt='where you can find a power supply unit'>-->
				</a>
				<br>
				<br>
				<a href='pic/power_supply_unit_2.JPG' target='_blank'>
					Here the image.<!--<img src='pic/power_supply_unit_2.JPG' alt='where you can find a power supply unit'>-->
				</a>
			</p>
			<hr width='25%' id='border'>
			<p id='text'>
				<b> 3. Step </b>
				<br>
				Open the power supply unit with a screwdriver
				(you may need some force to open it, if not all screws
				can be removed).
			<p>
			<hr width='25%' id='border'>
			<p id='text'>
				<b> 4. Step </b>
				<br>
				After you opened the power supply unit, you should already be
				abled to see some Capacitors (picture 1). Get the biggest Capacitor
				possible out of it by pushing it up and turning a bit on it.
				<br>
				Here a picture of the capacitors i got out of my power supply.
				The biggest or the one i used for my taser is 3cm/1.5" in height.
				(the one on the far right).
				<br>
				<a href='pic/Capacitors.JPG' target='_blank'>
					Here the image.<!--<img src='pic/Capacitors.JPG' alt='different capacitors'>-->
				</a>
				<br>
				Here a picture of the capacitors on a motherboard
				(I only have a old motherboard left	to spare, so i cannot show
				pictures of the original power supply unit. But I think you get the idea.)
				<br>
				<a href='pic/capacitors_on_motherboard.JPG' target='_blank'>

				<b> 5. Step </b>
				<br>
				After you successfully removed a capacitory, hook it up to one
				of the 9V battarys (wear cloves, and protect your eyes in
				case the capacitor explodes.) After 10sec hold the two wires of
				the capacitor onto a piece of metall (at least 1m away from your
				body) and look if someting happens. If nothing happens, repeat
				the above said with more 9V batterys as long as nothing happens.
				If you can see a big spark, like in the video of my taser, then
				you shouldn't touch the wires of the capacitor in any any more(
				this could lead to you being electrocuted).
				<br>
				Now your taser is already finished. The only thing left to do is
				building a case for it.
			</p>
			<hr width='25%' id='border'>
			<p id='text'>
				<b> 6. Step </b>
				<br>
				The last step is building a case. I made mine using some old
				metall plates with wholes drilled into them. These holes allowed
				me to fix everything in place using just some srews.
				<br>
				If you do not have some spare metall plates, you can use the
				power supply units case. Just drill a hole into it and but the
				capacitor halfway through it.
			</p>
			<hr width='25%' id='border'>
			<p id='text'>
				<b> 7. Step </b>
				<br>
				The very last thing to do is connect the capacitor to the
				batterys with a button.
				<br>
				Just connect the two ends of the capacitor to two different
				wires. Wire1 should lead to nothing and the Wire2 should lead to
				the button.
				<br>
				Now only connect the wires to the batterys using the
				Crocodile clips and watch and you are finished.

			<br>
			Note: I don't know if you noticed, but i didn't charge the taser in
			any way. If you press the button for 10+ seconds and the release it,
			then the spark are much bigger.
