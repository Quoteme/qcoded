# QCODED

This is an archive of my old website from when I was 14 years old.
Most of the files in here were last edited back on 01.03.2015, but may
as well be a few years older.

This archive only includes the third version of my website, when I was
most proud of it and wrote all code regarding it myself.

Have fun looking into the past:
