							- Move = Arrow keys | directional buttons

							Writing this game was actually my dream for ~2.5 years.<br>
							one of the very first games I made in summer 2013
							(August 2013 i think) was called "Jump n runner".
							It included a character selection menu as well as 3
							levels and never got out of the alpha version.
							The only "programming language" I knew was Visual
							Basic, so i wrote this platfromer witch very many
							gliches and bugs in VB. There were problems all over
							the place, like collision detection not working and
							input handeling (which had sometimes a second delay).
							<br>
							But I never stopped thinking about this game and so
							I starded this "reboot" of it ~2.5 years later with
							much more computer skills, knowledge and the awesome
							framework PHASER for javascript.
							<br>
							I hope you enjoy this game and if you have any ideas
							for levels (like a drawing of a potential level), I
							would be glad to include it as a stage in Jump 'n
							Runner.
							<br>
							<br>
							Here are some Images of the first jump n runner from
							2013:
							<img src="pic/jump_n_runner_2013.png" alt="Image of jump n runner 2013" />

							<img src="pic/Jump n Runner.PNG" alt="another Image of it" />
							<br>
							Thank you for reading. If you want to download the
							2013 version, <a href="jump n runner 0.2.2.zip">here it is</a>.
							<br>
							Have a nice!
